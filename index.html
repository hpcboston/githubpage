          <h1>Competiton Overview</h1>
          <p class="lead">HPC Boston is a 2-day competition for undergraduate students.
            Student teams design and build a small computing cluster that can execute typical HPC workloads.
            Teams will be scored on their ability to successfully run the
provided workloads, as well as achieving at the best
            price/performance.</p>
            <h5>Team Information</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Teams are comprised of 2-4 currently-enrolled undergraduate
students. Each student team may have one faculty or graduate student advisor.
Once the competition starts, students may not consult with advisors for any technical questions. </li>
              <li>All team members must be available to attend from 8AM to 8PM on November 9th and 8AM to 12PM on November 10th</li>
              <li>During the the competition, food will be provided to students. Teams are strongly encouraged to find sponsorship for their hardware and transportation costs.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h5>Hardware Specifications</h5>
            <p>Teams must bring their own hardware to HPC Boston. There is a
$5,000 cap on hardware cost for each team's hardware. All hardware (including
racks and cabling) must be under this budget cap. Hardware must be purchased new and from retailers that are accessible to everyone.
              <br>
              <br>
              During the application process, teams will have an opportunity to
submit a hardware specification. This hardware specification list may change up
until two weeks before the start of the competition. At this time, a final
specification list must be submitted along with a detailed budget showing
receipts. All hardware purchased for the final system (including but not limited to cases and cables) must be included in this budget.
              <br>
              <br>
              This budget must include the following information for all components used in the final competition system:
              <ul>
                <li>Where purchased</li>
                <li>Price of equipment</li>
                <li>Quantity</li>
              </ul>
              Once the competition begins, the specifications of a system cannot be changed. In the event that a component fails during the competition, hardware may be replaced for the exact same hardware.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5> Judging and Prizes </h5>
            <p>Teams will be scored on their ability to complete the workloads,
as well as their HPCG score. A awards will be given for the best
price/performance.</p>

            <h1>Workloads</h1>
            <p class="lead">During the competition, students will be running a diverse set of workloads.</p>
            <h5> Preliminary Workloads </h5>
            <p>Teams will be required to run the <a href="http://hpcg-benchmark.org">HPCG Benchmark</a>,
              an industry standard benchmark designed to profile parallel systems.</p>
              <p> In addition, teams will be required to develop the below programs: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A graph-based search application</li>
                <li>A document string-search application</li>
                <li>A clustering-based application</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Finally, a mystery application will be announed on the day of the competition.</p>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>A detailed description of each workload will be posted
online by October 9th</strong></p>
